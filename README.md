## DESCIPTION OF THE SYSTEM
**Furniture Management System** is a Python-based application that models different types of furniture—such as Chairs, Tables, Sofas, and Bookshelves—using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Each furniture type is represented as a class, inheriting from an abstract base class called `Furniture`. The system allows for easy assembly and disassembly, showcasing the modular nature of furniture components.
