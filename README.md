## PROJECT TITLE
Furniture Management System

### TEAM MEMBERS

### DESCIPTION OF THE SYSTEM
**Furniture Management System** is a Python-based application that models different types of furniture—such as Chairs, Tables, Sofas, and Bookshelves—using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Each furniture type is represented as a class, inheriting from an abstract base class called `Furniture`. The system allows for easy assembly and disassembly, showcasing the modular nature of furniture components.

### HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
Save the code in two files:
   - furniture.py (contains classes)
   - main.py (handles object creation and testing)

Run the Program:
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run:
python main.py

Expected Output:
The program will display details about each furniture item, including its material, size, weight limit, assembly, and disassembly instructions.

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
We would like to express our gratitude to our instructor Mr. John Richard Esguerra for providing the guidance and knowledge required to develop this Furniture Management System. We also appreciate the support of our classmates, whose collaborative spirit and feedback helped shape the project. Special thanks to the open-source community for providing valuable resources that inspired our design and implementation.
